# Archival IIIF server

The Archival IIIF server indexes and provides [IIIF](https://iiif.io) services for digital collections. The server can
be configured with a number of different services to index the digital collections and to create derivatives.

The [IISH](https://iisg.amsterdam) (International Institute of Social History)  has created a number of services to
index the DIPs created by [Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org) and to give access through IIIF.

## Components

The Archival IIIF server is composed of a web application and various service workers. The service workers index
collections to [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch), while the web environment
gives access to the index through various [IIIF API's](https://iiif.io/technical-details).
[Redis](https://redis.io) is used to manage the communication between various service workers and provides additional
caching capabilities.

## Services

The Archival IIIF server comes with several services that can be turned on or off using the env variable
`IIIF_SERVER_SERVICES`.

![](./docs/iiif-services.png)

### Default service

The `web` service runs the IIIF web environment.

### Workers

The worker services wait for new jobs to appear in a queue in [Redis](https://redis.io). A distinction is made between
index workers that indexes data in
[ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch) and derivative workers that create
specific derivatives of collection items. At the moment, the Archival IIIF server identifies a number of different
types of worker services:

- **Index worker**: Gets a job with the path of a collection to be indexed in
  [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch). Current implementations:
    - `iish-archivematica-index`: A specific IISH implementation of the index worker. Indexes DIPs created by the
      Archivematica instance of the IISH.
- **Text index worker**: Gets a job with a collection id and a list of all transcriptions/transliterations to be indexed
  in [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch). Current implementations:
    - `text-index`: Indexes plain text files and ALTO files.
- **Reindex worker**: Gets a list of collections ids to be reindexed or a query for
  [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch). Current implementations:
    - `iish-archivematica-reindex`: A specific IISH implementation of the reindex worker. Can start reindexing for
      DIPs created by the Archivematica instance of the IISH.
- **Metadata index worker**: Gets a job with a collection id and/or a OAI identifier and obtains the metadata from an
  OAI endpoint to be indexed in [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch). Current
  implementations:
    - `iish-metadata`: Looks for and indexes metadata from the OAI service of the IISH.
    - `niod-metadata`: Looks for and indexes metadata from NIOD.
- **All metadata update worker**: Starts the metadata process again for all items. Current implementations:
    - `all-metadata-update`: Default implementation.
- **Waveform derivative worker**: Gets a job with a collection id and then builds waveform representations of all audio
  files of the collection with the given collection id. Current implementations:
    - `waveform`: Default implementation.
- **PDF image derivative worker**: Gets a job with a collection id and then builds JPG representations of the first page
  of all PDF files of the collection with the given collection id. Current implementations:
    - `pdf-image`: Default implementation.
- **Video image derivative worker**: Gets a job with a collection id and then extracts a still as JPG and creates a
  mosaic of stills with a WebVTT file from all video files of the collection with the given collection id. Current
  implementations:
    - `video-image`: Default implementation.
- **Process update worker**: Gets the process type to start and a query for
  [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch). Current implementations:
    - `process-update`: Default implementation.

### Cron jobs

The cron job services run periodically. At the moment, the Archival IIIF server identifies one cron job:

- **Metadata update**: Checks periodically whether some metadata has to be updated. Current implementations:
    - `iish-metadata-update`: Runs daily to query the OAI service of the IISH for updates and sends those to the
      metadata indexer.

### Standalones

The standalone services do not wait on a trigger like the workers or cron jobs. At the moment, the Archival IIIF server
identifies one standalone service:

- **Directory watcher**: Watches a directory for any changes (new collections) and sends those to the index worker to be
  indexed. Current implementations:
    - `directory-watcher-changes`: When a directory has had no changes for a certain amount of time, it is assumed that
      it is safe to send the directory to the index worker to be indexed.
    - `directory-watcher-file-trigger`: When a directory is updated with a specific file, it triggers the index worker
      to be indexed.

### Libraries

The libraries are lightweight services with specific implementation details that can run together with the
`web` service on the same running instance. At the moment, the Archival IIIF server identifies three different
libraries:

- **Access**: Determines whether a user has (limited) access to a specific item. Current implementations:
    - `default-access`: All granted; default implementation
    - `iish-access`: IISH specific implementation.
    - `niod-access`: NIOD specific implementation.
- **IIIF metadata**: Provides implementation specific IIIF metadata. Current implementations:
    - `default-iiif-metadata`: Default (no IIIF metadata) implementation.
    - `iish-iiif-metadata`: IISH specific implementation.
- **Authentication texts**: Provides implementation specific texts to help the user with authenticating. Current
  implementations:
    - `default-auth-texts`: Default implementation.
    - `iish-auth-texts`: IISH specific implementation.
